## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Environment

To develop locally, you'll need to run both the frontend and backend environments. This requires two terminal windows.

1. In **Terminal 1**, run the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the frontend development environment and automatically open your app in the browser.

2. In **Terminal 2**, run the backend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev-node
   ```

   This will start the backend in watch mode, automatically restarting on code changes.

### Additional Scripts

- **Build for production**:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Start the production server**:

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```
