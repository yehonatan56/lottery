# Lottery

##  Description
My lottery application is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage lotteries.

### How it works
1. **Create a Lottery**: the admin can create a lottery by providing a name and a password.
2. **Join a Lottery**: users can join a lottery by providing the name.
3. **Spin the Lottery**: the admin can spin the lottery by providing the name and password. The application will randomly select a winner from the participants.

### Motivation          
On July 14th, there was supposed to be a lecture. A few days before, I thought of running a raffle — and then came up with the idea of a meeting about how to integrate artificial intelligence into your business. So I developed a raffle system.
